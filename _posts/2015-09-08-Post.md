In a recent paper, the feasibility of characterizing molecular dynamics simulations using two point statistics was demonstrated. In that work, simulations of single crystal aluminum were performed using different force fields at 300 K and 900 K following an equilibration period. The force fields were clustered by performing principal component analysis on the calculated two point statistics of the atomic positions at several time steps. It is now desirable to extend that work to look at a slightly more complex system. 

The results of molecular mechanics simulations of aluminum grain boundaries were obtained. These results contain the atomic positions, their potential energies, as well as centrosymmetry parameters. These simulations are periodic in the X and Z direction and nonperiodic in the Y direction. The grain boundary is perpendicular to the Y axis.

For this type of simulation, the two point statistics of interest are those in planes perpendicular to the Y axis.  Care must be taken to account for the fact that different simulations will have different simulation box sizes. This means that by defining a fixed voxel size, there will by a non-integer number of voxels in each direction in the simulation box. This is calculated by the normalized correlation of the XZ cross sections of two images: one image containing all the atoms in the box  plus some of those contained in adjacent boxes in periodic space (representing vector heads), and another containing only the atoms in the original box, but equal in size to the previous image (representing vector tails). The images are formed by first binning the atom centers in discrete space and then convolving this image with an image of an atom with a predefined radius. For aluminum, a conservative choice that reduces the chances of atomic overlap is the covalent ratius of 1.18 Angstroms.

The potential energy in the plane needs to be defined as it is almost surely true that no atom center lies within any given plane. The following definition is used:

Where E_i is the potential energy of atom i , A_XZ is the cross sectional area of the XZ plane, and A_i(t) is the area of the intersection of the Voronoi cell of atom i and the XZ plane at y=t.
